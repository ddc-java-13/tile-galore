## Summary

Construct tile sets from artwork images retrieved by querying one of several publicly accessible art-oriented repositories by keyword. Generate random tile arrangements from a selected tile set. In each turn, flip a pair of tiles: if the tiles match, the tiles are removed from the playing surface and the score increases; otherwise, the tiles are flipped face-down again. The time and the number of pair selections required to clear all tiles are recorded for display in a score summary screen.

## Intended users

* Laborers looking for a quick escape 

    > As a Warehouse employee trying to make sense of the chaotic package sorting lines in a fast pace environment I sometimes need a mental break and need to tune out to a game to give the internal battery a bit of time to recover.

* Students looking to exercise their brains 
    > Being a coding bootcamp student I like to play games that will challenge my brain and have me memorize things to keep my brain sharp in order to help me sharpen my coding skills.

## Functionality

* Creating randomly generated tiles with Color, Numbers or images.
* Show the user their top 10 most recent scores by difficulty.
* Show the user their most recent 10 scores by difficulty. 
* Memory exercises, basic or complex based on difficulty chosen. 

## Persistent data

For every game played:
* Level
* Difficulty completed on
* Time it takes to complete 
* Number of correct/incorrect guesses 

## Device/external services

TBD

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

* Being able to choose a greater difficulty and having more complex patterns as a result
* Having images of known places around your location be on the image of some tiles depending on GPS location
